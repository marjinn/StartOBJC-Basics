@interface LifoList()
{
    Node* _head;
    /*
     * This variable basically is our linked list
     * 1)For one instance of LifoList 
            has an instance of Node 
            which has two variables
                    1)NSString* string
                    2)Node* next
            The second variable of the type Node is of
            the same type as the class(Node) itself
            therby making any  variable which is of type Node
            getting an unending (linked ) list of variables that belong to Node class
     
     eg:
     _head	Node *	nil	
         NSObject	NSObject
        _string	NSString *	nil
        _next	Node *	nil
            NSObject	NSObject
            _string	NSString *	nil
            _next	Node *	nil
                NSObject	NSObject
                _string	NSString *	nil
                _next	Node *	nil
                    NSObject	NSObject
                    _string	NSString *	nil
                    _next	Node *	nil
                        NSObject	NSObject
                        _string	NSString *	nil
                        _next	Node *	nil
                            NSObject	NSObject
                            _string	NSString *	nil
                            _next	Node *	nil
                                NSObject	NSObject
                                _string	NSString *	nil
                                _next	Node *	nil
                                ... and on and on and on
     
              So To store a value we use the 1st 1) variable "string" of Node
                    and the second 2) variable of type Node will be set everytime
                                we add a new member to the list
                
              i.e,
     
                   step (1) [node setString:string];
                            this sets the "string variable of" node -
                            which is  a local instance of "Node" hence gets both 
                            "string" and "next"(which is of type node) from Node
                   step (2) [node setNext:_head]
                            get LifoList's _head(Node) and assign it to "next"
                            thereby making its "string" and "_next" same as 
                            that of _head
                   Step (3) _head = node;
                            Set _head of LifoList to node
                            i.e everytime  you add a new object the exiting 
                            _head will be set to _next (Node) variable
                            and then the new Node object with it's modified _next
                            which houses all previous modifications to _head
                            will be set to _head
                            Hence we get all modification ,no matter how many of them
                            are there
                            Same trick can be repeated with structs
